### Radical Mnemonic
There are ==legs== inside a box (==mouth==). How many legs do you have? You have ==four== limbs total, but specifically two legs. But the box itself has four sides, so this represents ==four==!

### Reading Mnemonic (し/よん)
You need to remember ==four== is also considered unlucky in Japan because し sounds like "death" (死). So people often say よん instead to avoid the bad association.
