This is the ==hand== radical. If you look at the palm of your right hand, the lines in it probably kinda look like the lines in 手. Sure it's not a perfect match, and everyone's got different hands, but basically this radical looks like the lines in your hand.

You could also think of the horizontal lines in 手 as fingers. That would make for a pretty alien-looking hand, but still a hand… of sorts…
