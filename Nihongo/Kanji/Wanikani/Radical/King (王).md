This is the ==king== radical. Picture this king sitting on his solid, squarish throne. The top stroke is the high back of the throne. The cross in the middle is his body, with his arms spread out on the arm rests. The bottom stroke is the ground. See him sitting there now, looking all dignified. Talk about a kingly king.
