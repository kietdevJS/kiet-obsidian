There's a stick and a giant toe stuck in the ground. Imagine walking along and seeing these things in your path. What would you do? Most likely come to a complete ==stop==. You know, because of the toe. I guess a normal stop sign wasn't good enough, so they also put up this big toe to really get people to stop.
