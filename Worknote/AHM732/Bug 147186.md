Problem: SITA MVT contains airline specific delay code is not handled (alpha code and numeric code)

==FACB commented: we cannot send SITA MVT messages (or SAS MVT) with delay codes that are other than **2 characters**, or sub delay codes that are other than **3 characters** ^e1f872

A sub-code "06" will not be able to match to "6", only the other way around. 

>This is the flow when searching for a sub-code match:

1. Try to find an identical match - "06"  
2. If no match is found, try to find a match with a leading zero - "**0**06"
