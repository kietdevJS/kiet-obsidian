Link ADO: [Bug 159055 [131996] Airline specific delay code not handling codes in lower case](https://dev.azure.com/airhart/CPH/_workitems/edit/159055/)

Problem: delay code are case sensitive, and md lookup failed -> updated business rule to case insensitive.

Fix implemented, however only testable by testportal, since adapter still validate message with case sensitive delaycode [[Bug 147186#^e1f872]]
(decided not to update messaging contract w Thomas Bjorn https://dev.azure.com/airhart/CPH/_workitems/edit/159055#8757579)
