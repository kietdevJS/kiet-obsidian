JUN/2024

ALDJ suggested a list of items to be fixed in this change
- [Bug 161214 [Stretch] [131996] SITA MVT - Handling of delay sub-codes](https://dev.azure.com/airhart/CPH/_workitems/edit/161214/)
- [[Bug 159055]]: Case sensitive delay code 
- [[Bug 122401]]: Delay subcode should have alert rfr01a (jens)
- [[Bug 147186]]: Airline specific subcode not handled 

FACB commented: 

We've found issues in how we handle delay codes in our rules. We assume that:    

1) Iata and Airline DelayCodes will be 2 characters    
2) Iata and Airline SubCodes will be received as 3 characters    
3) Iata and Airline SubCodes should be transformed into 1 character

But in md, airline delay code can be any length -> enrichment rule wont work

Jacob and Aldj decided to remove length restrict in mapping and enrichment rule, ==code chage not found !
